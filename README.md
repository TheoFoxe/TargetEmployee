/* tasks the user has to encounter problems on
 
 
  Task 1: There's a big electronics sale going on and, during your organization of each subsection of items into alphabetical categorization so that you don’t get so many people asking where a specific brand of item is (wisdom + 2), a mob of customers suddenly come rushing into the store to try to loot everything!
 
options to solve:
 
     1) Hold them back using only your massive pecs (strength)
       SUCCESS: There is no way for any amount of bodies to break through your perfect defense, as abs upon abs block the mob from causing any unnecessary havoc.
 
       FAILURE: Overconfidence is a menace, and you clearly overestimate your body's strength. Some guy sucker punches you to the ground, allowing the mob to wreak chaos in the store. All the while you just lay on the floor. Like a baby.
 
     2) Action roll between them to avoid being trampled (dexterity)
       SUCCESS: Like a Dark Souls master, it doesn't matter what is thrown at you as long as you can perfectly action roll. You bob and weave throughout the crowd, keeping you alive.
 
       FAILURE: You try to action roll through the crowd when you immediately have your spine stomped on mid-roll. The mob just walks over your screaming body.
    
     3) Tear off your shirt and blend in among the crowd (wisdom)
       SUCCESS: Taking off your uniform and throwing on a black hoodie from the clothes aisle, you blend in among the crowd, but also attempt to divert the crowd away from the store into the Walmart next door...
 
       ...and it works! The crowd is aware of your presence and follows the person who shouts the most. Now the rival store has your problem to worry about.
 
       FAILURE:  Taking off your uniform and throwing on a black hoodie from the clothes isle, you blend in among the crowd, but also attempt to divert the crowd away from the store into the Walmart next door...
 
       ...and instantly get beaten up. Somebody forgot to take off their target employee lanyard, and stood out like a sore thumb in the crowd as an anti-mob figure.
    
 
 Task 2: Moving shopping carts in the parking lot (dexterity + 2), you spot a granny is walking outside from the store to her car when a speeding car comes into view!
   options to solve:
 
     1) use a bunch of connected carts and ram the car before it can hit the old lady (strength)
         SUCCESS: You run your shopping cart into several others, locking them into place, until you have a literal battering ram. The car comes quickly and, getting closer to the lady...
        
         ...gets t-boned by your battering ram of shopping carts and flies into the street, rolling over several times before exploding like a Michael Bay movie. The old lady thanks you for your service, leading to a good newspaper story promoting the store and its employees.
 
 
 
         FAILURE: You run your shopping cart into several others, locking them into place, until you have a literal battering ram. The car comes quickly and, getting closer to the lady...
 
         ...hits her. The lady goes flying out of existence, the car speeding off blaring A7X, and your shopping cart battering ram hits a parked car after missing, in which you spend time buffing out the dent.
 
     2) try to do a "high speed scoop up" of the old lady in one of the shopping carts (dexterity)
       SUCCESS: You start to get speed while running your cart towards the old lady. Hitting 60, no 70, no, 88 MILES PER HOUR!
 
       At the last second you point the nose down, scoop the old lady up, and travel back in time right as the car was about to hit you.
 
       You appear seconds before the accident took place near the store with the old lady. She is busy thanking you when this timeline's version of the old lady gets hit by the car and flies away. The police are left in confusion at the both dead and alive old lady, but at least one of them is safe.
 
       FAILURE: You start to get speed while running your cart towards the old lady. Hitting 60, no 70, no, 88 MILES PER HOUR!
 
       And then you hit the lady going 88 miles per hour. She didn't go into the cart but rather got stuck to the front of the vehicle as both you and her slam into a wall. You may be a mess, but the old lady just had an instantaneous funeral and burial into a brick wall.
 
     3) you think the lady looks a lot like Margaret Thatcher. Let the car hit her (intelligence)
       SUCCESS: You think that the old lady looks exactly like Margaret Thatcher and, knowing how much of a pain she is, do nothing to prevent the car from hitting her.
 
       The police admire you for your efforts and the manager as well! Apparently Margaret Thatcher has been revived and talking about retaking England, so it's good that you put a stop to it.
 
       FAILURE: You think that the old lady looks exactly like Margaret Thatcher and, knowing how much of a pain she is, do nothing to prevent the car from hitting her.
 
       You realize after you find the body that it was not, shockingly, Ms. Thatcher. What a twist. You make up an excuse to the manager to hide the old lady before anyone notices, and lose work time.
 
 
 Task 3: You are working on the local branch’s company site (intelligence + 2) when someone attempts to send a virus to the local computer due to a security fault!
	
options to solve:
 
	1) Unplug and replug the computer (wisdom)
	SUCCESS: You quickly try to unplug the computer before the virus fully transfers, but
make sure to get the save state out via an external hard drive before something happens
to it. After rebooting and restoring the PC, you have saved the branch from a large amount of sudden data loss, which your manager is grateful for.
 
FAILURE: You quickly try to unplug the computer before the virus fully transfers. After all, if it doesn’t work, try turning it off and on again. However, you turn on the computer and the virus keeps installing! After burning down the computer before any major data gets stolen, you are berated by the manager for your failure to realize what the external drive was for, as well as your overreaction. By burning the PC down.
 
	2) Work through the virus to temporarily shut down the site (constitution)
	SUCCESS: The virus has already started deploying, putting out screen-blocking adds to
	stop you from interfering with the final download. But you trail on, clicking through close 
	button after close button, and finally manage to get to the main page to cancel the
transfer.
 
	FAILURE: The virus has already started deploying, putting out screen-blocking adds to
	stop you from interfering with the final download. You try to get through every obscene
‘	and scam-obvious add, but before long you are overcome by an infinite number of adds,
	as you watch your software slowly rot away with the data loss.
	
 
	3) Try to plug the security hole so the virus doesn’t fully transfer (intelligence) 
SUCCESS: After a tedious process of both utilizing the antivirus software and working
on the site’s securities, you manage to finally cut the constant installation of the virus and save the data that would otherwise be lost to somebody mysterious…
 
FAILURE: You try to patch the security holes on the website to stop the transfer, but aren’t smart enough to just come up with an easy solution. Eventually you succumb to the realization of your demise as the files have been stolen during your slow work. You lose a lot of work time just attempting to save something...
 
 
 
 
Break: Lunch Break or quick break (tells you how you are doing so far)
 
Here is how well you are doing right now:
 
 charisma points
 strength points
 constitution points
 dexterity points
 intelligence points
 wisdom points
 
Task successfully cleared = number / 6
 
0 / 6 = poor, you are getting close to failing your workday, pick up the pace!
 
1 / 6 = ok, but not good enough 
 
2 / 6 = good, only one mistake means you have a better chance of not failing the workplace
 
3 / 6 = excellent, keep up the good work!
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Task 4: While busy stocking items in the storage room (strength + 2), an employee gets stuck on the top rack of a storage rack in the room after his ladder falls and breaks!    
 
options to solve:
 
     1) try to parkour between the rack that the employee is stuck on and the opposite rack (dexterity)
 
	SUCCESS: You quickly grab from one rack to another higher rack on the opposing time with some rope in your hand until you reach the employee, being fast enough not to topple either rack storages. You use the rope to help the employee climb down, and save some time possibly waiting for other help to get him.
 
 
	FAILURE: You attempt to backflip onto one rack and then jump to a higher opposing rack, but on the backflip you hit your head on one of the rack platforms. This ironically causes the employee to fall from rack to rack and eventually on top of you. While he is safe, you suffer some injuries and have to work through the pain during your shift.
 
     2) instruct the employee on how to get down (charisma)
 
	SUCCESS: You instruct the employee to get down on the far side of the rack not facing the opposite direction, and your commanding confidence inspires him to overcome the dangers of being at that height. You tell him the exact points to grab on his way down so he doesn’t topple the rack, and watch him safely recover at the bottom. You saved the company a lot of time and money trying to get him back down!
 
	FAILURE: You try to instruct the employee to get down on the side of the rack, but when he does it starts to topple over; he just barely reaches back to not completely fall down, and will now not listen to anybody. You call the fire department to finally get him down later but wasted a lot of time in doing so.
 
     3) try to use the remainder of the broken ladder to get down to the lower part of the opposing rack to get down (wisdom)
 
	SUCCESS: You know that using the ladder could work to get him, but with the other side broken off you will have to climb up the pole of the ladder to get to him. It would probably slip off the ground if you placed it there, but you find a sturdy clamp nearby, and instead use it on one of the lower opposite racks to make the ladder diagonal, and less likely to slip with it being pushed into the clamp and supported by the rack. You wiggle up with some rope to help the employee climb down, and save some time possibly waiting for other help to get him.
 
	FAILURE: You know that using the ladder could work to get him, but with the other side broken off you will have to climb up the pole of the ladder to get to him. You place it on the ground, but aren’t wise enough to see that it might slip with force given to it. After climbing ever so close to the rack and the employee, it gives way and you watch as you slam to the floor. Now you have to work your shift with an injury...
    
 
 
 
 
Task 5: While working the cash register and talking to customers (charisma + 2), a Karen walks screaming into the Target, upset that she bought 3 jeans that were labeled as blue jeans when they were "dark blue." 
   
options to solve:
 
     1) convince them you are the manager, and hold superiority (charisma)
       SUCCESS: As she finishes her rant about the unfairness of customer treatment and the malpractice of business in relation to jean colors, she demands to speak to your manager.
 
       You hold up your hand, with power and boldness, acting as the last defense against American hypocrisy.
 
       "I am the manager."
 
       Your voice echos for miles upon miles. While an initial lie, the presence you hold convinces her, leaving her writhing at the core. The last thing you hear of her before she dissipates into the floor below is "I'M MELTING! I'M MEEEEEEELLLTIINNGGG..."
 
       FAILURE: You try to convince her that you are the manager, but unfortunately the real manager comes out at the exact same moment. She sees right through the attempted lie and, appalled at your audacity to even claim such power, screams in rage.
 
       Everything goes dark for a second, and when the darkness dissipates, you see everything in the store tossed around like a tornado came in.
 
       The karen is gone, but you spend an unnecessarily long time cleaning the mess up.
      
     2) Use your legal prowess to prove that you are in the right (intelligence)
       SUCCESS: You clearly assert that the customer is wrong in this case, that the store is selling the right color of jeans, and that the dark blue color is in the defined spectrum of "blue", not counting as mislabeling. Just as she starts to make a rebuttal, you take out a copy of the legal manual instated by the Target company, and instinctually flip to the exact line that declares it. She tries to say something but just starts stuttering, and runs out.
 
       FAILURE: You try to tell her that dark blue is legally a label of blue, but start stuttering as you fall to the ground unconscious. Now you have an official lawsuit against the local branch for "jeans not being blue".
 
     3) Stand strong against her yelling (constitution)
       SUCCESS: The shouting and screaming commences, making eardrums blow out of nearby customers and glass to start shattering. But you keep your cool, thinking about your day, wondering what's for lunch, and if Cyberpunk 2077 will ever release...
 
       By the time you come back to reality, the Karen just stands there in disbelief at your constitutional strength, and retreats out of the store when she is caught by a guard for vandalism (breaking the glass windows with her yells).
 
       FAILURE: You try to stand up to the bully karen, but her voice booms harder and louder than any person on earth. Your body can't handle it as you watch yourself quake and crumble to the ground. The karen simply walks over your ragdoll body, looking for its next prey...
 
 
 
 
 
 
Task 6: During your time cleaning out the bathrooms and withstanding the horrible stench  (constitution + 2), some sewer rats start emerging from the toilet water!
   
options to solve:
 
     1) Use rat poisoning on the toilets (intelligence)
       SUCCESS: With your knowledge of the proper application of pest determent, you set touch-based traps within the toilets and watch as the rats climbing out fall back in.
 
       FAILURE: You have poisoned the toilet. What the actual hell. A customer eventually comes out screaming bloody murder because some backlog toilet water got on his behind and hes now irritatedly itching his pants.
 
     2) Convince the king of the rats to buy at target (charisma)
       SUCCESS: You summon the King of the rats from the toilet using toilet paper as fine parchment. You successfully convey a peace treaty and an economic endeavor that has the rats using Target as their exclusive trade partner!
 
       FAILURE: You summon the King of the rats from the toilet using toilet paper as fine parchment. However, your difficult attitude geared towards cleaning the bathroom is conveyed to the King as a declaration of war. Now Target has to hire pest control and pull a Robespiere for the rat kingdom.
 
     3) Try to plunge them back down the toilet (strength)
       SUCCESS: With the strength of Zeus himself you fight against horde after horde of rats, and none get past the rubber curtain of your mighty plunger!
 
       FAILURE: You put down the plunger into the toilet, but the rats just chew through the rubber. Actually, they just chew right through the porcelain of the toilet, and even through the linoleum floors. Are you sure these are rats?








FINAL MESSAGE



YOU ARE NOT FIRED

So you have made it. At least half or more of the trials and tribulations of the American workforce have been overcome by you. Now what?

You do it over again.

And over.

And over.

And a billion times over. 

Because humanity is inherently flawed. It makes mistakes, and it causes turmoil for those around it. It bleeds and soaks those near and below. But that’s what makes Target survive. The blood and sweat of the twisted human mind requires a workforce to counter itself, to protect itself from itself. You are that workforce. And only one thing truly prospers from it, thrives upon such mistakes from humanity, turns it into a market where it sells the product, the people, that can fix itself..

TARGET.

FINAL MESSAGE



YOU ARE FIRED

So you have failed. More than half of the obstacles presented bested your efforts. Now what?

You move on.

You face an economic crisis.

You try to find a new job.

Because humanity is inherently flawed. It makes mistakes, and it causes turmoil for those around it. It bleeds and soaks those near and below. But that’s what makes Target survive. The blood and sweat of the twisted human mind requires a workforce to counter itself, to protect itself from itself. And that workforce makes even more mistakes. You are that workforce. And only one thing truly prospers from it, thrives upon such mistakes from humanity, turns it into a market where it sells the product, the people, that can fix itself, only to make more and more mistakes.
